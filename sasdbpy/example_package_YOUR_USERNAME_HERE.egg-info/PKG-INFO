# Sasdbpy

This is a simple helper class to read and use data stored in sas7bdat format, without having Sas.

This code will help you:

- explore a folder and identify all sas7bdat present therein
- have them organized in a python dictionary with, for each file:
    - the data as a pandas Dataframe
    - a field name mapper from the coded field name to the description from the meta data
    - a more detailed fields characteristics dataframe with information of Type, Length, Format
- Two search functions on the field names:
    - search_field, to identify fields from the database containing a certain string
    - search_field_description, to identify fields from a string contained in their description
